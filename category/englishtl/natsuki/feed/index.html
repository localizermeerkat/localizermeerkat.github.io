					<description><![CDATA[<p>“It’s okay, you don’t have to be so stiff. Just relax.”<br /> <br />The other student—seated at the desk—spoke in a gentle voice.<br /> <br />He wasn’t wearing an armband, but there was only one person in the entire school allowed to sit in that chair.<br /> <br />“Nice to meet you.”<br /> <br />I said.<br /> <br />Though I’d seen him from afar, this was our first conversation, so it felt appropriate.<br /> <br />He responded:<br /> <br />“Yeah, nice to meet you. I’m Tokimoto Kazusa, the student council president.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-13/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>“Kageyuki-san, you’re not mad?”<br />&#160;<br />“Huh? Me?”<br />&#160;<br />“Yeah.”<br />&#160;<br />“No, I’m not mad, but…”<br />&#160;<br />“…I see…”<br />&#160;<br />She gave a small nod, like something clicked for her. Then—<br />&#160;<br />“Well, I look forward to working with you.”<br />&#160;<br />“Wait—now you say that!? After all this!?”<br />&#160;<br />It kinda sounded like she wanted to keep using me for story material.<br />&#160;<br />I wasn’t sure how to feel about that. I might need some time to think it over.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-12/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />Now that I think about it, it’s strange. If she was just going to introduce me to the student council president, Kimiya could’ve just asked me straight up. I wouldn’t have refused even without all this buildup.<br />&#160;<br />She’s helped me enough to deserve that. Actually, even if she hadn’t, it’s not something I’d turn down outright.<br />&#160;<br />Despite that, Kimiya took the time to prepare a handmade lunch before bringing up the topic.Of course, the lunch might have just been something she made separately, completely unrelated to what she wanted to talk about—but the timing was just a little too perfect for that.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-11/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I’ve heard the reason you chose this school, Sou-san.&#8221;<br /> <br />Kimiya said.<br /> <br />Just like she said, of all people, I had only told her the real reason I picked this school.<br /> <br />—Because I want to deal with human relationships in a calculated way.<br /> <br />I didn’t share the full details. It’s not like I have some concrete goal.<br /> <br />But even though I only explained my general intent, she still offered me her support without asking for more.<br /> <br />&#8220;That said, I can’t agree with you pushing yourself so hard.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-10/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>These days, robot vacuum cleaners are getting pretty advanced, but they’re still just flat disks, and I wasn’t about to let them take over my job. For now, there was still demand for what I did.<br /> <br />&#8220;…Alright. That should do it.&#8221;<br /> <br />Looking over the cleaned-up clubroom, I muttered to myself with a sense of accomplishment.<br /> <br />It wasn’t exactly sparkling, but it was more than good enough for regular use.<br /> <br />Apparently, the Drama Club mostly used the practice spaces and performance hall in the main building, so they didn’t often come to their clubroom.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-9/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>At the request of this self-proclaimed fairy who refused to lift a finger, I pushed open the door labeled Second Literature Club &#8211; First Clubroom.<br /> <br />The moment I did, the sight of a cluttered room—and one girl sitting inside—greeted me.<br /> <br />&#8220;…………&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;————&#8221;<br /> <br />The girl inside froze, staring at me with a what the hell? expression.<br /> <br />Can’t blame her—some random guy just walked in carrying a person. As for the fairy on my back?<br /> <br />&#8220;I’m home, Mina!&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-8/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p> <br />Before me (well, below me) was a teary-eyed, enigmatic girl, staring up accusingly.<br /> <br />&#8220;It hurt so much… I thought I’d die…&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;S-Sorry! I didn’t think we hit that hard…&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;But my butt hurts.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;I said I’m sorry!&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;My round butt got flattened…&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;I-I mean, what am I supposed to do about that…?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Like the lunch pack.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;…………&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Like the lunch pack.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Saying it twice doesn’t help!&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;I’ll haunt you.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Me specifically!?&#8221;<br /> <br />She really holds a grudge.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-7/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I got the request this morning, right after parting with Shiranui and returning to the faculty office.<br />&#160;<br />After returning the borrowed key to Hiyama and reporting that Shiranui had been using the room, he sighed wearily.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I see. As long as that’s confirmed… Really, Tokimoto-kun…&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />He muttered, thanked me, then shook his head in exhaustion.<br />&#160;<br />I’m not sure what exactly he found convincing, but it seemed unrelated to me.<br />&#160;<br />And so, Hiyama’s request came to an end—though the conversation continued because, for some reason, an unfamiliar upperclassman girl was also present.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-6/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Just kidding. I was only messing with you.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;You…!&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Anyway, nice to meet you. At least I won’t call you by your first name, so don’t worry.&#8221;<br /> <br />I added that last part casually.<br /> <br />It wasn’t anything meaningful, but Shiranui narrowed her eyes slightly at the remark.<br /> <br />&#8220;…There’s someone who might make that complicated.&#8221;<br /> <br />Her voice was so quiet it sounded more like a murmur to herself than a reply to me.<br /> <br />Hearing that, I asked without thinking much of it.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As I watched puzzled, the girl quietly removed her hands, let out a small sigh, and murmured.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;……Guess I’m not scared after all, huh… me……&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Seems like she wants to be scared. Huh. I see. …What kind of feeling is that, anyway?<br />&#160;<br />What would it take for someone to end up thinking like that? The more I dwell on it, the more curiously it pulls me in.<br />&#160;<br />Shoulders slumping (?) at her own lack of intimidation, Shiranui talks to her reflection in the mirror.&#8230; <a href="/how-i-came-to-call-you-natsuki-volume-1-chapter-1-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
