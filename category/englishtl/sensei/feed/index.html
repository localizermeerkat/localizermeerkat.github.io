					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 8: Various Intentions<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />Several days had passed since the departure of the heavyweights. Stroman was running through the village after being called by the guards at the south gate. The sun had already begun to set, and the time was transitioning from evening to night.<br />&#160;<br />When Stroman arrived at the south gate, one of the guards was talking to three individuals who appeared to be adventurers.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Ah, Stroman-san.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-8-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In truth, Kimijima had been practicing remote control of trees based on Regress’s advice, but she still hadn’t grasped the feeling. Spells’s approach, grounded in the basics taught at the magic academy, was undoubtedly the correct one.<br />&#160;<br />Spells looked around at the trees in the forest.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Vines are probably the easiest to use.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Saying this, he pulled some vines off a tree and tore off the tendril parts. After gathering a few, he returned to Kimijima.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-7-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been about a month since Mera was born. She still can’t fly, but her form has been becoming sharper recently.<br />&#160;<br />Despite being a Firebird, Mera loves bathing, so after meals, we’d let her bathe in the river that flows near the town.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Brrr. It&#8217;s cold!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />As soon as they arrived at the river, the students quickly took off their shoes and stepped into the water. The river, flowing down from the mountains, had a refreshing chill to it.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-7-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 7: The Sage</h3>



<p>&#160;<br />About a week had passed since then, and with Regress’s help, I continued to climb the ranks, leading to days that felt monotonous and unchanging. During this time, Doodle Valley welcomed a new guest.<br />&#160;<br />When I was called into Yarzak’s room, I found Yarzak, Stroman, and two strangers waiting. One was an elderly man around sixty years old, dressed in robes, and the other was a slightly plump middle-aged woman around forty, clad in armor.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-7-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;Whoa! Miki, you use light magic? That’s awesome. It’s rare, you know.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Really? It’s rare?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Yeah, not many people can use light for offense. Light’s the fastest among attack magic. If you master it, it’ll be insane.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Fufufu. I’ll master it!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />For some reason, Regress and Sakuragi seem to get along really well. Regress also seems knowledgeable about magic, giving Sakuragi advice on how to fight as a mage. Sakuragi seems frustrated that she only knows the basic light attack magic she learned at the Sky Temple.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-6-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 6: Regress</h3>



<p>&#160;<br />A few days after the incident, as the tension gradually began to ease, another adventurer arrived in the village.<br />&#160;<br />Lately, I had been pushing myself hard every day to climb the ranks, so today I decided to take it easy, sleep in, and take a leisurely stroll around the village. As I returned to the village to settle some magic stones, I was called to Yarzak&#8217;s office.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Actually, last night, an adventurer arrived.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-6-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The next day, when we went to the outpost, one of the state soldiers called out to me.<br />&#160;<br />It seemed the spear I had ordered was ready. They told us to come to the blacksmith.<br />&#160;<br />I had kept the spear order a secret from Kimishima. I wanted to surprise her with a gift.<br />&#160;<br />Kimishima and the others wanted to come with me, but I told them to go ahead without me. We had planned to hunt nearby today to feed Mera, so I told them to go on their own.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-5-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 5: The Footsteps of Disaster</h3>



<p>&#160;<br />The next day, the three of us set out with the road repair team, determined to climb the ranks once more. Perhaps because of yesterday&#8217;s conversation with Pardomikhov, all three of us were brimming with motivation.<br />&#160;<br />Today, Mr. Stroman joined us.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;By the way, the other day, Miree-san used magic to bind Sid. Was that really as impressive as it seemed?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Yes, it is quite difficult to immobilize someone ranked in the triple digits.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-5-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>After finishing my conversation with Yarzak, the four of us headed to the cafeteria together. The cafeteria was adjacent to the outpost, and it was a bit crowded since it was mealtime.<br />&#160;<br />“How about over there?”<br />&#160;<br />There was a long table available in the back. After securing our seats, we went to the counter to get our food.<br />&#160;<br />Today’s menu… grilled meat, perhaps? Steak? That’s a pleasant surprise. Along with some vegetables, we filled our plates and brought them back to the table.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-4-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Chapter 4: Vito&#8217;s Inn</strong><br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />When we arrived in town, I thanked Pardomikhov and returned to the dormitory where I was staying. The students seemed to be out somewhere, so I decided to take a walk around the village alone.<br />&#160;<br />As I was about to leave, I hesitated for a moment. &#8216;Should I carry a short sword with me?&#8217;<br />&#160;<br />Thinking about it, I’ve been quite careless until now. I used to carry weapons in my backpack because it could hold anything, but if I were attacked in that state, I wouldn’t be able to defend myself.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-4-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
