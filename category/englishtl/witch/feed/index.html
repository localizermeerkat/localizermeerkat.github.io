					<description><![CDATA[<p>District Five’s club [West] was run by a small-time crook named Mikhail, who’d had dealings with Rogue for a while. True to his nature, Mikhail had a sharp eye for dangerous figures and would immediately grovel if he sensed trouble—a living embodiment of &#8220;bend with the wind.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Amid heavy bass, Rogue and Miseria were led by bouncers to a VIP room upstairs.<br />&#160;<br />The glass-walled room overlooked the lively crowd below.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I don’t get the appeal of dancing.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-2-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Hey. Don’t you ever think about getting out of here?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I do. I thought about it when I was imprisoned in the Undeworth, and I think about it every night here, too.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />(See? In the end, you just want out.)<br />&#160;<br />Catherine lowered her brows.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Hey, Investigator… Did you know? If a witch contributes enough to an investigation, she can receive a pardon.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />So even witches weren’t expected to work for free.&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-2-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />A faint smile—just a millimeter—tugged at Rico lips. With a small bow, she hauled Humafu deeper into the hall. As Rogue absently watched them disappear, his anger reignited.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…You really had to drag me into that?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />His voice was sharper than he expected. The one responsible—still sprawled on the floor where she’d been tossed—answered lazily.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Ahh, my apologies. But Rogue-kun, you’re so reliable. You were really cool back there.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Don’t say things you don’t mean.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-2-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>&#160;<br />The man they had taken into custody was Zach Noll. His occupation? Dealer—specializing in slipping past pharmaceutical laws.<br />&#160;<br />Though Zach ultimately revealed nothing beyond what torture had already wrung from him, he did mutter a few barely audible words about himself.<br />&#160;</p>



<p>He admitted to mixing illegal drugs in that room.<br />&#160;<br />That he was a war veteran with nowhere else to work, so he had no choice.&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-2-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;……Stop this. I’ll send you back to prison.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Miseria&#8217;s gaze, which had been fixed on the man, slowly shifted to Rouge. Her cheerful expression remained unchanged.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Just a few more rounds, and he might crack. And yet, you want me to stop?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;……I never asked for this from the start.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;But it’s the most efficient way, isn’t it?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;……Just stop.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Is this about your pride as an investigator?&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-1-part-6/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Miseria took another step forward, and Rogue took another step back.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Honestly? I couldn’t care less if this case gets solved. The only thing I want from this investigation is [fun]. If you provide that, I’ll help with anything.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Her eyes gleamed as she theatrically extended her hand further.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…Fun?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />One more step back. His back hit the wall. Miseria’s gaze locked onto his, her pupils burning.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Exactly. Understood?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…Like hell I do.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-1-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

Director Velladonna did emphasize urgency.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />He stiffened but shook his head. None of this was fair.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;……If I’d known witches were involved, I wouldn’t have come.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-1-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />Most citizens today likely couldn’t comprehend how dangerous they were. After all, Witches had been reduced to cautionary tales—&#8221;If you misbehave, a Witch will come for you.&#8221; Their atrocities were now distant legends, softened by time.<br />&#160;<br />Just as Rogue tensed—<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Ah, have you awakened, Miseria?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />At Rico’s words, Rogue stiffened. The girl called Miseria was slowly opening her eyes. Her long lashes fluttered before lifting fully.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Oh dear. Have I slept too long again?&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-1-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />Velladonna smiles faintly. Then, deliberately adjusting her seat in the chair, she says:<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;That’s right. They’re rushing us from above—&#8217;Hurry up and catch the Life-Taker,&#8217; they say. Well, if you don’t want to, that’s fine too. But what do you think? Or maybe you’d prefer going to Navaco? Being thanked by the elderly isn’t so bad, you know? A young person like you willing to do manual labor would surely be welcomed with open arms~&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Crossing her legs elegantly, she poses the question.&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-1-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 1: The Witch Cannot Be Collared<br />&#160;</p>



<p> <br />The walls of the headquarters’ director’s office were lined with framed portraits—the faces of the [Two Great Nobles]. Every single one of them had golden eyes, eerie as a cat’s. Unnerving as they were, removing them wasn’t permitted.<br /> <br />&#8220;Congratulations, Rogue! You should be thanking me!&#8221;<br /> <br />The moment he was summoned, his superior, Velladonna-Villard, declared.<br /> <br />Director of the Royal Capital’s Ireil Branch Bureau—that was Velladonna’s title. She always delivered news abruptly.&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-1-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
