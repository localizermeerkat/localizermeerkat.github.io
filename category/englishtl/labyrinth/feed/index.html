					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;Welcome, guests! I’m Lenden of the Golden Hammer! Now, hand over your money!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Golden Hammer, huh…&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Encountering a member of the infamous Blacksmith Guild, known for their skill and greed, Ur wasn’t sure whether to be happy or annoyed. His expression turned complicated.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Now, hand over your money.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Lenden’s unwavering demand for money left Ur half-dumbfounded and half-impressed. It was similar to what he’d seen in the Great Sin City-State of Greed, but it seemed everyone associated with it was the same.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-4-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Satellite City-State of Alto, Central Street, Knight Order Headquarters</strong><br /> <br />──I’ll prepare everything, so you two, make sure you’re ready for the fight ahead.<br /> <br />After an intense meeting, Ur and the others were given an hour’s grace period and concise instructions before disbanding.<br /> <br />Diz hadn’t given them specific instructions on what to prepare. No matter how capable Diz was, she couldn’t know what Ur and the others were capable of or what they needed. Only they knew that.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-4-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Your targets are the undead soldiers and the surviving bandits. And rescuing the hostages. You’ll be acting as a diversion, but we’ll give more specific instructions once we arrive at the scene.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Next, Diz spread out a map of the surrounding area of the satellite city-state Alto.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;The problem area, the bandits’ stronghold, is to the north. It’s a ruin known in historical texts as <em>Canaan’s Fortress</em>.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Diz pointed to the base of the Arpas Mountains.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-4-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Chapter 4: Countermeasures, Meditation, and Desires</strong><br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />There was no deep reason. No deep thoughts either.<br />&#160;<br />Originally, he had belonged to a traveling brigade that moved from place to place within the ranks of the <em>Nameless</em>. However, due to his bad habits and misconduct, he frequently caused trouble and was eventually expelled. Drifting aimlessly, he fell into the clutches of a bandit group, remaining thoughtless until the very end.<br />&#160;<br />Even when he participated in the heinous act of attacking a mobile fortress, a crucial part of the city-state’s infrastructure, he didn’t think much of it.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-4-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p> <br />The knight order of the satellite city-state of Alto was not a particularly large force.<br /> <br />Of course, compared to the great sin city-states, the satellite city-states were smaller in both scale and population, and so the size of their knight orders was proportionate. Naturally, the threat of monsters existed regardless of the city’s size, but the larger, more dangerous monsters often headed toward the more populous great sin city-states.<br /> <br />Mostly, the knights were occupied with maintaining order due to the influx of people and goods at the mobile fortress’s docking port.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-3-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Fighting bandits isn&#8217;t a bodyguard&#8217;s job. Oh, and even if I die in this mission, it&#8217;s not your responsibility. I&#8217;ve already instructed Jenna to pay you in full.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I──&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;More importantly,&#8221;<br /> <br />Diz pointed at Ur. Her smile was gone, and her voice was cold and clear.<br /> <br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be of any use.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;────&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;So, stay out of the way and wait quietly, okay?&#8221;<br /> <br />[Don&#8217;t worry, Niitan, I&#8217;ll go with her.]<br /> <br />Before Ur could respond, Akane gave him a thumbs-up.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-3-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ur was witnessing what could only be called a miracle.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;【────】&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Even as dawn broke, the golden girl, Diz, continued her life-saving efforts, chanting spells.<br />&#160;<br />Before her hands was a passenger who had been severely injured in the earlier undead rampage. The man, with a deep gash in his abdomen and unconscious, was being treated while his wife and children gripped his hands.<br />&#160;<br />And soon,<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;【────】Done.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Diz declared succinctly. The children and the wife were momentarily stunned by the abruptness of her declaration, but as Diz removed her hands, the man began to breathe quietly.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-3-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;This is going to be a pain…&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />[Diz!]<br />&#160;<br />But at that moment, Akane, who had been binding one of the bandits, called out.<br />&#160;<br />Diz turned to see a new undead soldier appear beside the fallen Rose and pick her up.<br />&#160;<br />She had thought the area around Rose had been cleared, but Diz frowned and immediately raised a hand.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;【Thunderfire】&#8221;<br />&#160;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 3: The Golden Dash</h3>



<p>The head of the bearded man slipped cleanly off his shoulders.<br /> <br />It was such a swift strike that there was no sound of tearing flesh. That only made it feel even more unreal.<br /> <br />The bearded man’s face remained frozen in a dazed expression, as if he hadn’t even realized he was dead. His head rolled to the ground and came to a stop at the feet of his companions. Even as blood gushed from the remaining body, the atmosphere still felt like some kind of sick joke.&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-3-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;You’re a knight, right? Stay here and protect this place.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />This place might not be safe either. Whispering so the evacuees wouldn’t hear, Ur furrowed his brow with a complicated expression.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I’m technically a bronze-ranked adventurer. Don’t worry about me.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Considering he’d only been an adventurer for a month, &#8220;technically&#8221; was a stretch, but he kept that to himself.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Alright. But if it gets too dangerous, run. No one will blame you.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/thus-the-boy-runs-through-the-labyrinth-volume-2-chapter-2-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
