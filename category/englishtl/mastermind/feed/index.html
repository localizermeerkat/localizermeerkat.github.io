					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Zervis before him was no inkling of his household&#8217;s noble dignity remaining.<br />&#160;<br />Eyes bloodshot, hair disheveled in a ghastly visage<br />&#160;<br />no different from starving urchins scrapping over scraps in the slums.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;A pathetic sight, Zervis Ornament.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />With a tone almost pitying, Kurtz spoke:<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;As one who calls himself a Duke of the Six Great Households, standing at the empire&#8217;s apex…you should remain unwavering and steadfast in the face of any hardship befitting the head of a Ducal line.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-7-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for everything, Kurtz.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Lying on the bed, Artesia gave a faint smile.<br />&#160;<br />However, the light was gradually fading from her eyes.<br />&#160;<br />Her amethyst pupils were already unfocused.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;You served me more diligently than anyone else. You understood the pride and aspirations that the Eisenhud family has upheld for generations, and remained unwaveringly loyal to me until the very end.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Turning her face toward Kurtz, she tried to move her left hand slightly.&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-7-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;—Then I take it this child would not be an issue?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Patting Kurtz&#8217;s shoulder beside her, Feiyu stated.<br />&#160;<br />Seeing Kurtz&#8217;s presence, Klaus furrowed his brow slightly in inquiry.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Come to think of it, I was wondering about that child…?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;A poor child from the capital. When I fled the fire, he showed me a discreet route and guided me to where Lady Mercator&#8217;s daughter was, as one who aided my escape.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-6-part-6/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;In that case, Your Imperial Majesty, may I present the reparation demands from our side that the Duke of Ornaments must meet?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…Very well, I shall receive your official proposal.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Rest assured, while there were indeed faults on our part in imposing upon the palace, my demands will be reasonable in light of you graciously overlooking that transgression.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />While Feiyu offered Klaus a serene smile, inwardly Zervis was likely feeling anxious, though not overly apprehensive.&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-6-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;If I may be so bold as to return those words to you, Your Majesty &#8211; could you provide an explanation for the outrageous actions your Empire has taken against us?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;…Indeed, it would seem this is no simple matter to settle.&#8221;<br /> <br />Seeing that Feiyu did not falter despite addressing her assault, Klaus received the situation gravely and nodded solemnly.<br /> <br />&#8220;Then let us hear both sides in detail &#8212; Grand Duke Ornament.&#8221;<br /> <br />Calling out the name of the party Feiyu mentioned, Klaus glared silently.&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-6-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />By using the &#8220;Philosopher&#8217;s Stone&#8221; sleeping in Felmund&#8217;s lands and ensuring operational use of the magitek weapons, they could seize the initiative and surpass the other ducal houses.<br />&#160;<br />For that, House Ornament had bided its time.<br />&#160;<br />Taking utmost care never to let the Stone&#8217;s existence be discovered, pouring their house&#8217;s lifeblood into researching it, inheriting the will of generations of heads to realize this plan, they had strained every effort.<br />&#160;<br />No unexpected event was enough to shake a house not so weakly soft.&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-6-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;No…I just felt like I saw you give a genuine smile for the first time.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I do smile normally too, you know.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Mostly just wry smiles, cold smiles, and scoffs towards me though.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s because everything you say is so dull that I can&#8217;t help but make those faces.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to put it that bluntly! Granted, I may not be good at that sort of thing, but I was trying to make conversation thinking of you cooped up in the capital!&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-6-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 6<br />&#160;</p>



<p> <br />It was a cloudless sunny day.<br /> <br />For that reason, Artesia decided to hold today&#8217;s meeting on the palace terrace.<br /> <br />&#8220;You really haven&#8217;t changed a bit from usual, have you Artesia?&#8221;<br /> <br />As he was about to tilt his teacup, the man sitting across from her gave a wry smile.<br /> <br />Seeing his demeanor, Artesia responded in her usual manner.<br /> <br />&#8220;You seem more tense than usual, Klaus.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Ah…just thinking about today&#8217;s meeting was enough to keep me up with stomach pains…&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Then you can just sleep during the meeting.&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-6-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;…So the actual Philosopher&#8217;s Stone exists?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Yes. At the very least, it&#8217;s considered close to a substance meeting their definition.&#8221;<br /> <br />Minerals imbued with the land&#8217;s magic power are called &#8216;magic ores&#8217; and gain properties like absorbing, releasing, and storing magic power.<br /> <br />Devices incorporating these magic ores as power sources are called &#8216;magic tools,&#8217; allowing simplified magic use despite being expensive, with their magic power replenishable.<br /> <br />Moreover, the entire Empire is constantly bathed in abundant magic power from the World Tree.&#8230; <a href="/become-the-mastermind-volume-1-chapter-5-part-7/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
