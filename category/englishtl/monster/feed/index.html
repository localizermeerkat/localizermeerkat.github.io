					<description><![CDATA[<p>Detective Harrison Leonard’s office was located in the basement of the Balldlum Police Department.<br /> <br />Sandwiched between the morgue and the autopsy room, the placement felt like a deliberate slight—because it was. His role as the liaison between Cartesius and the police wasn’t publicly acknowledged, and his habit of butting into investigations outside his jurisdiction had earned him no favors among his colleagues.<br /> <br />Not that he cared.<br /> <br />Ever since getting involved with Unlaws years ago—or more precisely, since being recruited by Cartesius—he’d accepted the isolation.&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-2-chapter-1-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p> <br />&#8220;To cut to the chase, this time it’s not an investigation. It’s a fugitive capture. And not an [Unlaws]—just a regular human. Though we are allowed to kill them if necessary.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Hmm. That is unusual… no, stranger than that. Isn’t [Cartesius] supposed to be the shady organization managing [Unlaws]? Since when did they start doing the police’s dirty work?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;I won’t deny the ‘shady’ part, but technically, they are a government body. I asked my sister about it, but she dodged the question.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-2-chapter-1-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;Hyahaha! You got me, detective!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />The brown-skinned woman heard the shout from behind.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Don’t forget!

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Epilogue<br />&#160;</p>



<p>In a windowless office, Norman faced two women.<br />&#160;<br />Sphere Hamish.<br />&#160;<br />She had the same hair and eye color as Norman, wearing glasses &#8211; the chief of the Cartesius Balldlum branch.<br />&#160;<br />Behind her stood Iris Norton, a woman in a black suit with black hair. She was an intelligence officer who mainly scrutinized and collected information on the Unlaws within the city, also serving as Sphere&#8217;s secretary.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Well then, how are you feeling?&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-1-epilogue/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Nooooooooooooormaaaaaannnnn!!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />As the black sky gradually whitened to welcome the morning, a scream rang out.<br />&#160;<br />Who the five turned their gazes toward was Jim, in an appearance too gruesome to call merely covered in wounds.<br />&#160;<br />His entire body was drenched in blood, with broken bones piercing through the flesh everywhere. His arms and legs pointed in strange directions, and his gait was unsteady.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I saw it! What happened just now! That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been seeking!&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-1-chapter-5-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />Norman took a step forward. Pressed at the knee, Jim followed the same motion.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;You may be basically immortal, but it&#8217;s just basically. You can&#8217;t recover spilled blood. Your physical structure is still human.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Another step forward.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;And there must be a limit to how much you can regenerate. The later wounds clearly took longer to heal compared to the first ones.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />That&#8217;s why Norman let himself get shot &#8211; to time how long it took the eye injury to heal.&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-1-chapter-5-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;You call them monsters. But really, how disgusting. Take a look in the mirror.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Branding them as &#8216;Unlaws&#8217; monsters. Using them as weapons, as tools. Exploiting them for your own conveniences, desires and selfishness. Not recognizing their human rights, only seeing their abilities.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Which one is really the monster?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />If they committed crimes of their own will, if they used their abilities as they pleased, it&#8217;s understandable that they be punished. But if not?&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-1-chapter-5-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Norman flipped all the switches in his mind.<br />&#160;<br />When acting together with Shizuku and the others, Norman would switch between his thoughts, abilities, and actions.<br />&#160;<br />Not holding back, but purely so they could fully unleash their abilities, as that led to exponentially quicker incident resolutions. More importantly, to meet what he demanded of them.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…Oh? What&#8217;s going through your mind?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;The train hijacking, that was well done.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Switching the rail lines, you mean?&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-1-chapter-5-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>&#8220;So, you understand now, Norman? Let me reiterate your criminal charges. Disturbing public order. Property damage. And the suspicion of going against the Cartesius Order. Do you see why you ended up in this situation?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;No, not at all. Especially that last one is completely unfounded.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Is that so? Weren&#8217;t your regular trips to the capital part of the preparation for that?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;You know I was just going there as my sister&#8217;s proxy to report to headquarters.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-1-chapter-5-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The existence of Unlaws becoming public knowledge would only breed suspicion and paranoia. It&#8217;s better if their existence remains hidden. Living day-to-day wondering if your neighbor has strange powers would be exhausting.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />That&#8217;s why Knocker Cromwell&#8217;s goal was too much of a pipe dream and idealistic.<br />&#160;<br />It would have caused far greater chaos beyond just the incidents individual Unlaws could create.<br />&#160;<br />He must have understood that, and acted anyway.<br />&#160;<br />The result was Norman and Cklares alone on the derailed train.&#8230; <a href="/i-tell-you-monster-volume-1-chapter-4-part-6/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
