					<description><![CDATA[<p>……How much time had passed? After sinking into sorrow, a creeping dread began to seep into Yufia’s heart.</p>



<p>The grove stretched endlessly around her, thick with underbrush. There was no sign of people nearby.</p>



<p>Her body was still weak, her limbs bound. Even when she tried to use magic to free herself, for some reason, she couldn’t summon it as usual.</p>



<p>Her parents were away in the royal capital for work一no one was home.</p>



<p>Which meant… even if she never returned, no one would notice.&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-2-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Beside the sniffling Yufia, he spoke while staring at the opposite wall.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;When I said I wanted to be the strongest magician…… You told me I could definitely do it, right…?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;……&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Yufia buried her face deeper into her knees, but Shion continued.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;My parents, everyone around me… they’re all good people. But not a single one of them actually believes I can become the strongest magician. Some think I’m joking. Others say they support me, but deep down, they think it’s impossible.&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-2-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Oh… I see… So, what do you two usually do?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />On the surface, it was just an ordinary question.<br />&#160;<br />But something in the girl’s tone carried an unsettling undercurrent.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;What do we do? Well, she teaches me magic sometimes, or we talk about books we’ve read. Stuff like that.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Shion answered casually, his tone unchanged.<br />&#160;<br />……But immediately after, the atmosphere around the girls shifted sharply.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Oh… I see… Um, IchIchinose-kun, I really hate to say this, but…&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Huh?&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-2-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>To Yufia, magic had always been a chore forced on her by her parents.<br />&#160;<br />Master one spell, and another awaited. No personal goals, no satisfaction in progress.<br />&#160;<br />She’d never found it captivating, let alone cool. Had she been born without talent一into an ordinary life一she might’ve been happier.<br />&#160;<br />Then he asked:<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Ever read stories as a kid? The wizards in those一didn’t they seem cool?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Stories… books……? I’ve… never read any……&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Wait, never?&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-2-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 2: Yufia Queensroad<br />&#160;</p>



<p>Magical education institutions, known as &#8220;magic academy,&#8221; taught sorcery over six years of elementary division followed by three years of middle division, with children enrolling at the age of six.<br />&#160;<br />Yufia Queensroad attended one such school一the Terence Magic School.<br />&#160;<br />Unlike Crawford Magic Academy, where she currently studied, Terence did not divide classes based on academic ranking. Instead, students were reassigned each year to ensure each class maintained a balanced overall performance.&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-2-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Not missing this opportunity, Kevin gave orders while enduring the pain of his creaking ribs. Several meters away, Som and Dominic somehow managed to get up, deployed magic circles, and took aim.<br />&#160;<br />Kevin himself also deployed a magic circle and directed his full-power magic at the man without any mercy.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Lion&#8217;s Roaring Flame [Roar-Flare-Leone]!!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />From a bright red magic circle over one meter in diameter, a flame mass shaped like a lion was released.&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-1-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;You worthless failure… You really think you can lay a finger on an elite like me?! Tch—!!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Gritting his teeth with a furious expression, Kevin unleashed his magic at the approaching boy.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Lightning Strike: Thunderbolt!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />The spell Kevin cast was a basic lightning-based attack magic—&#8221;Thunderbolt.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Though fundamental, its power could be adjusted to stun the target, making it widely used for subduing rioters or incapacitating criminals without lethal force.<br />&#160;<br />Its true strength, however, lay in speed.&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-1-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p> <br />True, the dagger was undeniably crude and poorly made. But to Elliot, it was an irreplaceable memento—<br /> <br />the one and only dagger he had forged alongside his grandfather, who had passed away in his childhood.<br /> <br />—[Grandpa! Let me watch you work in the forge again today, please!]<br /> <br />—[Oho, Elliot! Back again, are ya? Course ya can watch all ya like!]<br /> <br />[Thank ya! Watchin’ ya work’s the best part of my day!]<br /> <br />[That so? Heh, warms my heart… But, Elliot… Ya sure ya shouldn’t be playin’ with friends instead?]&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-1-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 1: Elliot Freegan<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#8220;——……Damn it!!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />The man who kicked the trash can down the hallway in a fit of rage was Kevin Roberts, a second-year student of Class 2-A at Crawford Academy of Magic.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;That bastard… I wanna kill him!! Damn it!! Shit!!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Kevin&#8217;s eyes were bloodshot as he roughly ran his hands through his slicked-back hair, stomping through the scattered trash.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;That damn jerk… Just thinking about him pisses me off to my core…&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Seriously, that condescending attitude of his grates on my nerves…!!&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-1-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Prologue<br />&#160;</p>



<p>—Three Years Ago<br />&#160;<br />Ichinose Shion was surrounded by several upperclassmen.<br />&#160;<br />The location was behind the school building of Terrence Magic Academy, where Shion was enrolled at the time. In that deserted spot with no passersby, the upperclassmen glared sharply at him.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;The hell’s your problem? You protecting this guy?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Listen up, this ain’t violence. It’s justice. His bastard of a father, the vice mayor, embezzled our taxes—&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;So it’s only fair his son pays the price too, right?&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-prologue/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
