					<description><![CDATA[<p>Electronic Version Special Story: Marriage</p>



<p>&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;</p>



<p>I want to marry you three.</p>



<p>With these words, Trao pulls out three garnet rings.</p>



<p>This was the newly built main office of the Trao Trading Company, which also served as Trao&#8217;s residence.</p>



<p>Rio and the others thought that the living space alone was too large for the four of them to live together, but they had never imagined that they intended to take all three of them as their wives.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-extra-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Electronic Version Special Story: Trao Trading Company</p>



<p>Once known as &#8220;the Cat&#8221; for her nimble movements and swiftness during her adventurer days, Rio had now gained an imposing presence as the vice president of Trao Trading Company. Her bearing was more akin to that of &#8220;a Tiger.&#8221;</p>



<p>Today was the main store meeting, gathering branch managers from various locations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Osria Branch Manager, your progress seems poor. What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rio glared at the Osria Branch Manager with a menacing look.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-extra-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>&#160;<br />Kusanagi God was satisfied.<br />&#160;<br />The shrine had been rebuilt, larger in scale than before. High-quality furnishings had been selected. Most importantly, priests dedicated to serving Kusanagi God had been appointed.<br />&#160;<br />Every morning, these priests would offer prayers to Kusanagi God before beginning to clean the shrine. Thanks to their efforts, the shrine was always kept in a pristine condition, successfully exuding a solemn atmosphere.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-extra-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Electronic Version Special Story: The Circumstances of Blue Ring<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />Trao, who had just joined Blue Ring, decided to hear the stories of the three members right away.<br />&#160;<br />While Trao was happy to be invited to the party, he was equally anxious.<br />&#160;<br />(&#8220;Adventurers who need a merchant? They seem to be about my age, but I wonder what kind of financial sense they have?&#8221;)<br />&#160;<br />As a celebration for the new member joining, everyone decided to have a meal together.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-extra-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>[Reminiscence 5] At the End of the Battle<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;Berserk!&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />As Ganon shouted briefly, his body was faintly enveloped in a pale blue light, and in an instant, his eyes became bloodshot and turned bright red.<br />&#160;<br />Berserk is a skill that temporarily doubles one&#8217;s status at the cost of turning oneself into a mad warrior who continues fighting until all enemies are eliminated. While its effect is significant, it robs one of normal thought and stamina.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-chapter-23-afterword/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>[Reminiscence 4] Demon Majin Becker<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />The atmosphere in the Demon King subjugation team had become somewhat relaxed, but as they continued their journey, a fog suddenly began to thicken. Visibility worsened rapidly, and the surroundings were enveloped in a gray haze.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I sense magical power in this fog,&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Louise warned Rainer and Ciel to be cautious.<br />&#160;<br />Looking around, they noticed that other parties were also becoming aware of the abnormality of the fog.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-chapter-22/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>[Reminiscence 3] The Adventurers<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />A group of about thirty people was advancing through the wilderness.<br />&#160;<br />Their appearances varied greatly: some were clad in armor, others wore priestly robes, and some were draped in cloaks. Even among the armored individuals, who made up half the group, there was a wide range from light to heavy armor, giving the overall impression of a lack of uniformity.<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />This group was the Demon King subjugation team, centered around the adventurer party known as the Golden Fang.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-chapter-21/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>&#160;<br />Rio, Lilith, and Dominique grew up in the same town.<br />&#160;<br />Rio was the daughter of the town&#8217;s lord, Lilith the daughter of a bishop, and Dominique the daughter of a mage. Their parents were close friends, and being the same age and gender, the girls naturally became close as well.<br />&#160;<br />However, the peaceful era came to an end when the girls were thirteen years old.<br />&#160;<br />A demon appeared who had unified the lands overrun by monsters.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-chapter-20/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>[Reminiscence 1] Blue Ring<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />Trao was born into a merchant family.<br />&#160;<br />As the second son, he wasn&#8217;t the heir, but the family ran a large business and had plenty of money.<br />&#160;<br />However, due to his merchant-like father&#8217;s policy, the family lived frugally, leading an almost poor lifestyle. Still, Trao didn&#8217;t mind this and accepted it as natural.<br />&#160;<br />From a young age, Trao was a sharp child. He started imitating business practices early on and could earn his own pocket money.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-chapter-19/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;Mom! Is it true that Dad used to be an adventurer and defeated the Demon King?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Her son was looking at her with sparkling eyes.<br />&#160;<br />(Ah, so he&#8217;s finally learned about that…)<br />&#160;<br />Rio couldn&#8217;t help but hold her head in her hands.<br />&#160;<br />Her son, Rei, seemed to take after his father, being a bright child. He was good at sports and had a lovely face. He was a child without any flaws.&#8230; <a href="/the-exiled-merchant-volume-1-chapter-18/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
