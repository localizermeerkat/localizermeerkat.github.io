					<description><![CDATA[<p>[SIDE: Shenley]<br />&#160;<br />When I decided to go to Maple Leaf, I was terribly anxious at first, but as I spent time with everyone, my gloomy feelings changed. With reliable Sensei Aoi and the always cheerful and fun Aile and others by my side, even though we were walking in the Holy City of Maple Leaf, I had the illusion of being on a sightseeing trip to an unknown city.<br />&#160;<br />Meeting Sensei Cameron at the magic academy reminded me a bit of the painful past, but seeing Sensei Aoi silence him with sheer ability made my chest feel lighter.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-10-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;…You&#8217;ve already learned saint-class healing magic? Awad, what magic did you teach?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />As Diagio asked in confusion, Awad opened his mouth while tilting his head.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…Are you talking about that magic you saw just once? No, but how much could you understand from just one time? Even for the most talented magician, it would take years to comprehend the highest-level healing magic. Indeed, genius-type saints or holy maidens might create their own top-level magic, but to grasp someone else&#8217;s magic after seeing it just once…&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Despite being in front of Diagio, the country&#8217;s representative, Awad returned to his usual demeanor and began pondering.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-10-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;W-well then… How about having them demonstrate several useful and unprecedented magic spells? No, I won&#8217;t say it&#8217;s difficult. If you claim that researching new magic is the proper path for a magician, surely you have one or two achievements even at your young age?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />As Gem said this with a half-smiling expression, Rose gave a small laugh.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that creating new magic takes years, even decades. Isn&#8217;t that an unreasonable condition?&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-10-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 10: Permission<br />&#160;</p>



<p>It was my fourth day in the Holy City. I had been summoned by Diagio this morning. I was deeply disappointed, as this meant missing out on the chance to research healing magic and learn incantations in the laboratory. I might not even get to visit the lab today.<br /> <br />Feeling dissatisfied, I was led by Alabaster to the audience chamber.<br /> <br />I walked on the thick carpet I had trodden before, kneeling at the designated spot to lower my posture.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-10-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p> <br />[SIDE: Diagio]<br /> <br />After the scheduled audiences and meetings concluded, I reviewed the petition letters and budget reports from last month. The budget had increased from the previous time due to magical research and strengthening of magic academies. Reading this line reminded me of Aoi Kornominato, who should currently be touring the Holy City.<br /> <br />Questioning the methods of my predecessor, who relied heavily on saints, I had commissioned investigations and research into other countries&#8217; magic since becoming Emperor.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-9-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>[SIDE: Aoi]<br /> <br />After briefly checking the research content of each type of magic and demonstrating magic that could provide hints for future research, I realized that only healing magic remained.<br /> <br />At Crown&#8217;s suggestion, the number of people accompanying us increased with each visit to a research lab. As a result, the travel time between labs was filled with more and more questions. At the same time, I was also concerned about Crown&#8217;s sudden closeness.<br /> <br />&#8220;You mentioned that fire needs oxygen, but how exactly do you add that…?&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-9-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;…Do you understand?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />When I didn&#8217;t say a word, Aoi asked, seemingly gauging my reaction. How should I answer? Should I honestly say I don&#8217;t understand? Or should I give a vague answer to protect my pride as a small magician? The way of thinking and common sense I had as a magician until now were overturned in an instant.<br />&#160;<br />But perhaps sensing our confusion, Aoi turned their palms upward and began to speak.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-9-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>[SIDE: Crown]<br />&#160;<br />A senior instructor from Fidic Academy. She was quite young, with an appearance that didn&#8217;t look like an instructor at all.<br />&#160;<br />Many magicians have a strange sense of rivalry with Fidic Academy to begin with. The world&#8217;s top magic academy &#8211; many seem to simply believe the title and reputation at face value.<br />&#160;<br />However, as is likely the case in any country, most of the top magicians become court magicians. Whether it&#8217;s because they have family and can&#8217;t leave the country, or they simply seek status, fame, and money, becoming a court magician is generally the goal for most.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-9-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 9: The Magic Research Laboratory<br />&#160;</p>



<p>In the end, our discussions at the magic academy ended up focusing mostly on political matters, leaving no time to exchange information about magic circles and spells.<br />&#160;<br />Balbrea told me we&#8217;d definitely make time for that next time, and with that we left the academy for the day.<br />&#160;<br />By the way, it seems the students were given a proper tour of the academy. They were talking about the lecture styles and content, which apparently differed from Fidic Academy in interesting ways.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-9-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Now then, I&#8217;d like you to redraw the magic circle.&#8221;<br /> <br />When Balbrea said this, I checked the material of the rooftop floor. Conveniently, a large seamless rock was placed. The magic circle was drawn on top of it.<br /> <br />&#8220;It&#8217;s a large rock floor. It&#8217;s pitch black, but was it carved out?&#8221;<br /> <br />When I asked, Balbrea slightly lowered her chin.<br /> <br />&#8220;It&#8217;s a rock called black eye stone. When conducting magic circle experiments, we need to redraw many times.&#8230; <a href="/a-teacher-but-im-feared-as-a-witch-volume-2-chapter-8-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
