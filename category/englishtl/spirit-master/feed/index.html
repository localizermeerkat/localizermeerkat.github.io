					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Ever since a moment ago, these incomprehensible words have been flooding my mind! What is this!?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Incomprehensible words are flooding your mind?&#8221;<br /> <br />Owen furrowed his brow at Rourke’s explanation.<br /> <br />Beside him, Gareth was equally confused, wondering what Rourke was talking about. But Owen decided to focus on understanding Rourke’s situation.<br /> <br />From what Rourke described, it sounded like telepathy—a means of communication between a spirit and its contractor without words.<br /> <br />Normally, the spirit’s thoughts would be translated into understandable language within the contractor’s mind.&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-4-part-6/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Alright, everyone, let’s do this.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />At Owen’s brief command, the spirits scattered to the four corners, each stopping a few hundred meters apart. They drew their swords and plunged them into the ground.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Four Spirits Sealing Formation.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Owen knelt, placed his hand on the ground, and activated a spirit technique. A square barrier, incorporating the four elements, expanded from the spirits, enclosing the three of them.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Well, this should do for now.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-4-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;…You’re joking, right?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Nah, I’m dead serious.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />After meeting up with Gareth at the school gate, we started heading out of the city while I explained what we were about to do.<br />&#160;<br />As a result, Gareth was looking at me like I was insane.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Even if you could form a contract with it, you couldn’t just show it off, could you?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Even so, it would increase my spirit power reserves, and more importantly, it would be a mental stabilizer for me.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-4-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;So, why am I being dragged into this?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Training. You’re helping.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Ugh.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />The next day. While I was in the library trying to research evil spirits, Lily somehow appeared behind me and dragged me to the academy’s training grounds.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Do I <em>have</em> to be the one to help?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Since Linda is my opponent in the next rank battle, Rourke or Gareth would be the best fit.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Ah, I see.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Linda is a spirit master like me and Gareth, the type who fights directly on the front lines.&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-4-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#160;<br />&#8220;Generally, it’s said that forming a contract with one drives you insane. So maybe those with strong mental resilience are qualified to form contracts?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…………&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Is my mind that resilient?<br />&#160;<br />If anything, every time it seems like my lack of a spirit contract might be exposed, my stomach twists in knots. I don’t think I’m that strong…<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I don’t think it’s that simple. There’s probably something more fundamental…&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Lily shook her head at Gareth’s suggestion.&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-4-part-2/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

<p> <br />&#8220;Finally, things have calmed down, huh?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Yeah…&#8221;<br /> <br />Sitting side by side on a bench in the courtyard, Gareth and I exchanged those words as we absentmindedly gazed at the academy buildings.<br /> <br />Several days had passed since the attack, and the academy had finally regained its composure. Classes and the ranking matches had resumed, and everyday life was gradually returning to normal.<br /> <br />As for the damage, there were injuries among the disciplinary committee members, but no fatalities.&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-4-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Leia leaned in close, her face filled with concern, and Rourke instinctively leaned back a little as he answered. She let out a deep sigh, as if she had truly been relieved.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;…Really… I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;What about you, Leia? Are you hurt?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Though not as much as Rourke, she had also used a big technique, so her spirit energy must have been heavily drained. From what Rourke could see, she didn’t seem to have any major injuries, but he couldn’t tell if there was any internal damage.&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-3-part-9/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;What is that…?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s Loxley&#8217;s contracted spirit.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Rourke explains to Leia, who wears a look of astonishment.<br />&#160;<br />The Silver Knight, now resembling a silvery, gelatinous substance, writhes and contorts its body eerily. Its appearance is nothing like the armored knight it had been moments before.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;A Metal Slime. That&#8217;s the true form of the Silver Knight.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;A Metal Slime… I&#8217;ve never seen one before.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Leia, utterly shocked by the unexpected identity of Loxley&#8217;s contracted spirit, gazes at the Silver Knight with a stunned expression.&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-3-part-8/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p> <br />There stood Haunted, his cold eyes glaring down at her.<br /> <br />&#8220;That one strike of yours was good, but other than that, you were nothing but dead weight.&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;……!&#8221;<br /> <br />Haunted&#8217;s words pierced deeply into Leia&#8217;s heart, leaving her unable to think clearly even with the enemy right in front of her.<br /> <br />&#8220;…………&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Hah.&#8221;<br /> <br />Mocking Leia, Haunted slowly raised his sword and swung it down, aiming to sever her neck as she hung her head in despair.<br /> <br />&#8220;Who… said I was dead weight?&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-3-part-7/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Just as Rourke braced himself for the incoming blade, a red tail slammed into Haunted’s side, sending him flying out of sight.<br />&#160;<br />“Please don’t ignore me and push forward with your conversation.”<br />&#160;<br />Turning his head, Rourke saw Leia and Salamander glaring at Haunted, who had been sent flying. Salamander, in particular, had flames leaking from its mouth, clearly furious.<br />&#160;<br />“Ah, I got so focused on talking with Rourke that I forgot about you.”&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-3-part-6/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
