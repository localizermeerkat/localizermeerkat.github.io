					<description><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 2: In the Sakuragi Duchy<br />&#160;</p>



<p>&#160;<br />1<br />&#160;</p>



<p>Our visit to the valley of maids ended up being a bust for gathering information.<br />&#160;<br />That said, the maids promised to share any future leads with us, so in that sense, it was still a worthwhile trip. After all, maids have strong lateral connections.<br />&#160;<br />With that settled, the question became: Where to next?<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Hey, how about visiting my family’s place?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Huh? What do you mean—&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;N-No!?&#8230; <a href="/after-my-sister-enrolling-volume-3-chapter-2-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>“It’s okay, you don’t have to be so stiff. Just relax.”<br /> <br />The other student—seated at the desk—spoke in a gentle voice.<br /> <br />He wasn’t wearing an armband, but there was only one person in the entire school allowed to sit in that chair.<br /> <br />“Nice to meet you.”<br /> <br />I said.<br /> <br />Though I’d seen him from afar, this was our first conversation, so it felt appropriate.<br /> <br />He responded:<br /> <br />“Yeah, nice to meet you.

<p>&#160;<br />Several days had passed since the departure of the heavyweights. Stroman was running through the village after being called by the guards at the south gate. The sun had already begun to set, and the time was transitioning from evening to night.<br />&#160;<br />When Stroman arrived at the south gate, one of the guards was talking to three individuals who appeared to be adventurers.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Ah, Stroman-san.&#8230; <a href="/i-a-high-school-teacher-was-transported-volume-2-chapter-8-part-1/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

Just a sec.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />The girl pulled a large leather pouch from her coat and the jingle of gold rang out.<br />&#160;<br />But I couldn’t let that slide.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;Hey.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;What is it?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;How much do you think this sword is worth?&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />She froze like a pigeon hit by a peashooter, but after a brief moment of hesitation, she crossed her arms and gave it some thought.&#8230; <a href="/corpse-king-volume-1-chapter-3-part-3/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Ever since a moment ago, these incomprehensible words have been flooding my mind! What is this!?&#8221;<br /> <br />&#8220;Incomprehensible words are flooding your mind?&#8221;<br /> <br />Owen furrowed his brow at Rourke’s explanation.<br /> <br />Beside him, Gareth was equally confused, wondering what Rourke was talking about. But Owen decided to focus on understanding Rourke’s situation.<br /> <br />From what Rourke described, it sounded like telepathy—a means of communication between a spirit and its contractor without words.<br /> <br />Normally, the spirit’s thoughts would be translated into understandable language within the contractor’s mind.&#8230; <a href="/spirit-master-who-is-volume-2-chapter-4-part-6/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>……How much time had passed? After sinking into sorrow, a creeping dread began to seep into Yufia’s heart.</p>



<p>The grove stretched endlessly around her, thick with underbrush. There was no sign of people nearby.</p>



<p>Her body was still weak, her limbs bound. Even when she tried to use magic to free herself, for some reason, she couldn’t summon it as usual.</p>



<p>Her parents were away in the royal capital for work一no one was home.</p>



<p>Which meant… even if she never returned, no one would notice.&#8230; <a href="/c-level-magic-student-volume-2-chapter-2-part-5/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>District Five’s club [West] was run by a small-time crook named Mikhail, who’d had dealings with Rogue for a while. True to his nature, Mikhail had a sharp eye for dangerous figures and would immediately grovel if he sensed trouble—a living embodiment of &#8220;bend with the wind.&#8221;<br />&#160;<br />Amid heavy bass, Rogue and Miseria were led by bouncers to a VIP room upstairs.<br />&#160;<br />The glass-walled room overlooked the lively crowd below.<br />&#160;<br />&#8220;I don’t get the appeal of dancing.&#8221;&#8230; <a href="/witch-cannot-be-collared-volume-1-chapter-2-part-4/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>]]></description>
